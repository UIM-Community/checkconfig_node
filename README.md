# checkconfig_node
checkconfig with NodeUIM lib. (Example)

Simple prototype of Checkconfig script but with NodeUIM Lib. This project is here to bring a concrete example on how to use NodeUIM.

## Requirement 

- NodeJS v7.7.0 or higher (for async functions support).

## Installation 

```
git clone https://github.com/UIM-Community/checkconfig_node.git
cd checkconfig_node
npm install
npm start 
```

> **Intermediate state**: NodeUIM is not setup as npm package, you have to put manually 'nimsoft.js' at the root!
